# nhs-covid-data-analysis
This project analyzes NHS COVID-19 testing data using Python and pandas within a Jupyter Notebook environment. It focuses on cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format by converting messy entries to numeric values, handling missing data, and generating visual insights. The aim is to uncover testing trends across the UK and demonstrate practical data wrangling techniques. The dataset used is anonymized and complies with NHS data handling standards. All steps, from loading to visualization, are documented for reproducibility and educational purposes.
